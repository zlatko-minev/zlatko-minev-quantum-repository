# Zlatko Minev – Quantum Research Talks Repository

Welcome to the **Quantum Research Talks Repository** of [Zlatko Minev, Ph.D.](https://zlatko-minev.com) — an archive of public talks, keynotes, seminars, colloquia, etc. in quantum science and engineering.

> **Note:** This is not a complete list of all talks, particularly older ones which are hard to locate. For many talks given at multiple institutions, usually oonly one version is included here.

## 📁 Folder: `content - research talks`

Topics cover a range of research areas including:

- Superconducting circuits and Josephson junction arrays
- Whispering gallery modes
- Energy participation ratio (EPR)
- Circuit QED (2.5D and 3D)
- Qiskit Metal for quantum hardware design
- Quantum jumps and foundational quantum physics
- Error mitigation techniques (e.g., probabilistic error cancellation)
- Machine learning for quantum error correction
- Fibonacci anyons and topological quantum computing
- ...


## 🔍 Organization Notes

- File names follow the format:  
  `YYYY Title (Venue or Note).pdf`
- This folder is not meant for exhaustive archival or publication-grade citation. For citations, please refer to corresponding peer-reviewed papers or contact the speaker. PDFs saved here are in slighly reduced quality to the original in order to manage disk space.
