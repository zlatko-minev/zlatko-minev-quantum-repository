# Zlatko Minev Quantum Repository

A comprehensive collection of research presentations, lectures, tutorials, and technical notes by Dr. Zlatko K. Minev, spanning from 2011 to present. This repository serves as both an archive and a showcase of work in quantum computing, quantum physics, hardware development, and related fields.

## About the Author

Dr. Zlatko K. Minev is a scientist at Google Quantum AI and an Associate Fellow of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR). Previously at IBM Quantum, Dr. Minev built and led the Qiskit Leap research and Qiskit Metal teams, advancing quantum processor design and large-scale experiments with quantum error mitigation. 

A Yale Ph.D. graduate with distinction, Minev's groundbreaking dissertation on catching and reversing quantum jumps mid-flight addressed a fundamental quantum debate originating with Bohr, Einstein, and Schr√∂dinger, and was recognized as Discover Magazine's top Math/Physical Sciences discovery of the year.

Dr. Minev developed IBM's Qiskit Metal, the first full-stack quantum hardware design platform. He pioneered practical error mitigation methods, which became a backbone of quantum cloud experiments and are now widely adopted as a gold standard. Recently, his team pioneered the first use of AI for quantum mitigation beyond the 100-qubit scale.

Recognized globally, he has been named one of MIT Technology Review's 35 Global Innovators and was awarded the Presidential John Atanasoff Award. Outside the lab, Minev volunteers on the Board of Governors of the Yale Alumni Association and earned Yale's highest public service honor, the Yale-Jefferson Award, for his work championing science education and outreach.
